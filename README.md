### Expected behavior

Your users should be able to:

-   [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   [ ] Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
-   [ ] The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week," e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". It should read "Last Month" for monthly, e.g., "Last Month - 19hrs".

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
